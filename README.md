# Data-Science-Projects-With-Python-Second-Edition

This code accompanies the second edition of Data Science Projects with Python (TBD link to Amazon page and more description)

We recommend creating an Anaconda environment to be able to run all the code here. After installing command-line Anaconda, you can run the following lines in the terminal (Mac and Linux users) to create an environment with the required packages:

`conda create -n dspwp2 python jupyter pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn graphviz python-graphviz xlrd`

And then separately:

```
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost
conda install -c conda-forge shap
```

You can activate the environment like this:

`conda activate dspwp2`

and launch a Jupyter notebook interface in your browser with:

`jupyter notebook`.

(
TBD:
- try to get installation instructions in one terminal command
- include package version numbers
- Provide support for Windows, and possibly Anaconda GUI installation
)
